# Contribution Guidelines

Hello. ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to Chapter, the newest project for freeCodeCamp. We are glad you are here.

## We are just getting started

Implementation details are still being discussed and the project is currently at a very early stage.  The stage of the project is changing on a daily basis, thoughts and ideas are being contributed at a very high pace.

## What do we need help with right now?

We are in the very early stages of development on this new application. We value your insight and expertise.  In order to prevent duplicate issues, please search through our existing issues to see if there is one for which you would like to provide feedback. We are currently trying to consolidate many of the issues based on topics like documentation, user interface, API endpoints, and architecture.

## I found a typo. Should I report an issue before I can make a pull request?

For typos and other wording changes, you can directly open pull requests without first creating an issue. Issues are more for discussing larger problems associated with code or structural aspects of the application

## I am new to GitHub and Open Source, where should I start?
